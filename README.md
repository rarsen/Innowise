Simple Calculator
=================

This project is a simple calculator application built in **pure JavaScript** without using any libraries or frameworks. The code is bundled and optimized using **Webpack** so that the final build output contains only two files: **HTML** and **JS**. It adheres to clean code practices and implements ESLint for linting and optional Prettier formatting.
